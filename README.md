## 2. Why: The Problem and Our Solution

**The Problem:**  
The current landscape of NFTs largely focuses on the digital realm, often limiting the utility of these assets to virtual interactions and markets. This leads to a disconnection between NFTs and the physical world, which hampers widespread adoption and utilization.

**Our Solution:**  
Map3 Protocol bridges this gap by offering **real-world utility for NFTs**. Our platform enables NFT holders to unlock real-world benefits such as discounts, access to exclusive events, and community perks at partnered establishments, both online and offline. By using a **Web3-based map**, users can visualize their real-world transactions, track their benefits, and participate in community-based activities.

This integration extends the utility of NFTs beyond the digital world, allowing holders to see tangible benefits on their digital investments. Moreover, by using **Web3 technology**, we create a transparent, decentralized map of user activity that allows real-time data recording for better community and business engagement.
